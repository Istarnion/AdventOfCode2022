Advent of Code 2022
===================

My attempt at Advent of Code 2022

Even though AoC has a lot of text processing, I thought I'd attempt it in my normal style of C-ish C++.

## Build and run
To build, edit the `DAY` variable in `Makefile` to the solution you want to build, then run `make`.
This will generate the executable file `solution` that you can run.
Should work in all unix-ish environments. (I'm developing on macOS)
